Examples 
============== 
The `Highcharts demo page <https://www.highcharts.com/demo/>`_ is rich with examples, which should be generally readable for non-javascript coders. In addition, here are some additional python-based examples. 

The `Highcharts API documentation <https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/>`_ is also a fantastic resource to help construct charts.
